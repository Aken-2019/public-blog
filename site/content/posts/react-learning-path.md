This post records my React learning path. The content is organized by time order.

## The Official Tutorial
[The official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) guides you to build an online game board. To be honest, this is not a tutorial oriented for beginners with little JS knowledge. I followed the tutorial and was confused at the end of the tutorial.

## The W3Chools Tutorial
[The W3Chools Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/DEFAULT.ASP) is well organized. It introduces JS and React and the beginning and then the grammar. Most of my confusion about the official tutorial is cleared. I learned a lot more. 

After following this tutorial, I tried to create an interface for storing notes, but quickly got blocked and didn't know how to proceed. At that point, I knew I need another tutorial.

## The Mozzila Tutorial
[The Mozilla Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started) is **a very good one**. It guides you in building a to-do application, step by step. It hardcodes the app at the beginning and decomposes the app step by step. This process is nice and makes me feel the way of object-oriented programing.
