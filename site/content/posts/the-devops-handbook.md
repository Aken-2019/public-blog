Once my friend mentioned *DevOps*, and I got very interested in it even though I had heard it many times and seen the infinite loop figure as well. Perhaps it's because this friend looks professional and I want to look like that as well. As a result, I read this book.

## Overview
It's a good book for whom have some understanding of the roles in tech companies, such as developers and operational maintainers. A freshman without tech knowledge and experience may feel lost in this book.

Anyway, this is a very good book for me. Before reading the book, I only have a sense of what my colleagues are doing and how they are performing their jobs. However, I don't understand **why** they are doing so. After reading this book, I'm not only clear about the reason behind the job routine, but also able to identify where we can improve in the future.  

If you are unclear about the following questions (which I had), you should read this:
- Why are we using Jira (or other KanBan) to manage our tasks?
- Why are we using Jenkins?
- What is CI/CD?
- How to integrate test automation in our daily work?
- How should a successful DevOps team look like?

## Hightlights from the Book
Below is a quote from the book: 
> We describe value streams, how DevOps is the result of applying Lean principles to the technology value stream, and the three Ways: Flow, Feedback, and Continual Learning and Experimentation.
Primary focuses within these chapters include:
> - The principles of **Flow**, which accelerate the delivery of work from Development to Operations to our customers.
> - The principles of **Feedback**, which enable us to create ever-safer systems of work.
> - The principles of **Continual** Learning and Experimentation, which foster a high-trust culture and a scientific approach to organizational improvement and risk-taking as part of our daily work.

The book repeats these three concepts again and again, from a general introduction to practices. The tone of the book is too ideal and the practical advice is too abstract IMO. In this way, you'd probably be clear about the benefits of adopting DevOps about confused about how to. My way to address the confusion is to read more books and search for more information about detailed topics: such as DevOps in a data warehouse, DevOps using Cloud, etc.
