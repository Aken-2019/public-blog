I'm interested in Japan's economy bubble so I find this book, written by Masaaki Shirakawa. I read the translated version in Chinese. The book is full of economy jargon which I don't understand. The only thing I get from the book is that, political policies doesn't matter much if you are in a bubble. Something will trigger the economy, early or late. The underlying industrial of a nation really matters.

Now, China is not only under a real estate bubble, but also a dot-com bubble. Covid-19 harmed the global economy as well.  No idea how things will keep going but it should be similar to what happened in Japan.
