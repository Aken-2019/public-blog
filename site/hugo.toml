This is my little corner on the internet where I share learning notes and some nerdy thoughtsâ€”hopefully youâ€™ll find something useful (or at least fun) here.  

Right now, Iâ€™m exploring opportunities as a software engineer in Germany, especially around Python Backend, DevOps, and Data Engineering. I spend most of my time in Python and Linux, and I enjoy tinkering with them a lot.  

Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haojie-ni/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Aken-2019) if youâ€™re curious about what Iâ€™ve been working on.  
And if youâ€™d like the full story, my CV is available as a [PDF](/cv/H_NI-Python-Backend.pdf).
